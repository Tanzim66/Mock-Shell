//Sprint 2 Backlog.  
October 28 to November 3


User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) 27 - As a user, I can change the content of a file to a string I input if I specify a file that exists in my current directory.
b) 28 - As a user, I can append a string I input in a new line to the content of a file if I specify a file that exists in my current directory.
c) 29 - As a user, I can create a new file named as the file name I specify containing the string I input if the file I specify does not exist in my current directory.
d) 30 - As a user, I should get the string that I enter as an input prompted back if I do not specify a file to modify.
