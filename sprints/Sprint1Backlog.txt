//Sprint 1 Backlog.  
October 21 to October 27


User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) 1 - As a user, I can input any commands I want (valid or invalid) and get a message prompted back.
b) 2 - As a user, I am free use as many excess whitespace for valid commands and still function normally.
c) 3 - As a user, I can exit the program if I want to stop using it at any moment.
d) 4 - As a user, I can create two folders given the relative or full path so I can organize my current and future files on my system.
e) 5 - As a user, I should not be able to create a directory if there is an existing one.
f) 6 - As a user, I should receive specific errors if I give an invalid directory.
g) 7 - As a user, I can change my directory given the relative or full path so I can do other commands in a different part of my system.
h) 8 - As a user, I should not be able to only input one directory.
i) 9 - As a user, I will be able to view a list with all the contents in my current directory so I can see if the file I want is there or not.
j) 10 - As a user, I will be able to view a list with all the contents in a given directory so I can see if the file I want is there or not.
k) 11 - As a user, I want to be able to see what directory I am currently so I can navigate to my destination directory.
l) 12 - As a user, I should be able to access different directories without needing the full path.
m) Create CRC Cards
