What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Moved all the parameter requirements specific to a command inside the appropriate command class
    - Changed all the input variables of the functions executeCommand() to be the same so that we can change the design
    so that Command class is the parent abstract class with one function executeCommand that we can call from any of the other command classes.
    - Tested and fixed many bugs
    - Worked on History class and Echo class
    
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Finished project

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Not blocked yet
