What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Completed redirect for cat command
    - Completed redirect for history command

What do I plan to work on in the next three days?
    - add redirect to all STDOUT commands
    - test for bugs in these commands after implementation

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Having difficulties with handling user input that has the redirect symbols and handling outputs that need to be redirected
