What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Completed search command
    - Added restriction on man so that man only takes one command at a time
    - Added redirection to search command
    

What do I plan to work on in the next three days?
    - continue to add redirect to all STDOUT commands that are yet to be implemented (such as tree)
    - Add restrictions on search so that the expression accepted by it is surrounded by quotes

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Having difficulties with dealing with user input when trying to separate by space but leave spaces inside quotes untouched.
