What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Created Skeleton Code for List
    - Brainstormed the connections for List and Directory using CRC Cards

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Figure out the format of displaying the files and contents
    - Distinguish between relative and full path

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need Commands, Output, File to be somewhat finished so I can continue connecting them.
