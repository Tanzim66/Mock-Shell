What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Finished the makePossiblePath function in PathHandler that I used to complete the ChangeDirectory Class
    - Created a simplifyPath function for makePossiblePath so that it simplifies any path that the user input, such as removing all ".."s and "." and applying their properties on the path
    - Worked on the UserInput class and made it possible for us to split the Command portion of the user input from the Parameters of the user input, and I made it possible for Users to input quotes to indicate spaces between names

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Upgrade/Update the UserInput class so that users have restrictions on the names they can input such as not allowing users to input open quotes or double slashes
    - Work on Sprint 2

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Not blocked yet
