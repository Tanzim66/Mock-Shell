What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Completed redirect for pwd
    - Completed redirect for man
    - Re-designed Echo so that the redirection is easily accessible by other commands by making a Redirection class
    - Re-designed man, history and Concatenate so that the executeCommand function's purpose is to mainly take care of user input

What do I plan to work on in the next three days?
    - continue to add redirect to all STDOUT commands that are yet to be implemented

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Having difficulties with redesigning List to fit redirection since the code is a little complicated
