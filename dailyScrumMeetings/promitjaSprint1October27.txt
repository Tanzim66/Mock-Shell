What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Completed List command
    - Finished PrintWorkingDirectory
    - Worked on Output, added a few general errors

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Integrate Error messages to List
    - Create more specific Errors to commands in Output

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need userinput to completely work with inputs in order to improvise List iterations
