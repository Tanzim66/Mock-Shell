What did I work on in the last three days?
    - brainstormed design ideas with team to create CRC cards
    - initialized all class files based on CRC card design
    - wrote the base code for the Directory class and MakeDirectory class

What do I plan to work on in the next three days?
    - make sure that the Directory class is complete for use
    - complete the methods for the MakeDirectory class
    - provide prompt messages for any invalid user input
    - ensure that the MakeDirectory class is functional

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need Directory class to be complete before functionality can occur
    - May need Command class methods completed to provide error prompts
