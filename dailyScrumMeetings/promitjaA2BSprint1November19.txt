What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Base code for Move class
    - Created the plan for the Move class, fully commented on how everything is going to work
    - Added error messages in relation to the Move class
    - Integrated Move command to the JShell
What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Create function to move Directory with its child directories
    - Create function to check if a directory is a child of another
    - Finish Move Class

Am I blocked on anything?
    - If copy is completed, I can use parts of that code rather than duplicating code
