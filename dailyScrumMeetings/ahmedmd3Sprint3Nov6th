What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Planning to redesign crc/classes after recieving advice from demo
    - Changed the structure of classes so that they include their own error messages related to their requirem parameters inside their own classes

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - update crc cards with a new design and implement it
    - Work on error messages and test cases

Am I blocked on anything?
