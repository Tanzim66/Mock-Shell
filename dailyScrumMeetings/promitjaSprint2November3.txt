What did I work on in the last three days?
    - Made List take in as many paths rather than maximum 1
    - Finished PopDirectory
    - Added error messages when the directory stack
    - Added PushDirectory and PushDirectory functionality to JShell

What do I plan to work in the next three days?
    - Test List using files
    - Base code for EchoAppend
    - Manipulating files when there's no given file
    - Add more specific command errors

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need a way to create files so I can test if the functions work with them
